# Bookwise

Bookwise is a library management system built using modern web technologies to provide a seamless experience for managing library resources. The project leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering and React-based frontend, PostgreSQL for a robust and scalable database solution, Auth.js for secure authentication, and Redis for efficient caching.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Utilizes Next.js for server-side rendering and static site generation, ensuring fast load times and SEO-friendly pages.
- **PostgreSQL**: Implements PostgreSQL as the primary database for storing library data, ensuring data integrity and reliability.
- **Auth.js**: Provides secure authentication mechanisms to protect user data and manage user sessions.
- **Redis**: Uses Redis for caching frequently accessed data, improving the overall performance and responsiveness of the application.
